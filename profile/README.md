AniBeaver is a simple and straight-forward Anime Tracker for Windows, macOS and Linux. Built with Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform (Work in progress).
We strive to build an application which has good user experience, modern and clean UI and allows syncing your data with AniList.

If you want to help build the project (implementation, design, or just giving feedback/ideas) or want to chat with us, feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fknGNDGKJB).
